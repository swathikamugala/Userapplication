       The place to building any relationship is inside ourselves, inside our circle of influence, and our character.” Stephen R. Covey Relationship building has been a word for thought and emphasis.

This is often defined as “goal-setting”. But we don’t realize that our goals are influenced by our relationships.js </p>
